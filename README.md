# ï¿½ï¿½ CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN & Transfer Learning

## ï¿½ï¿½ Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We experimented with optimizers (SGD and Adam), model depth, early stopping, and transfer learning with VGG16. A web app is also provided to test the final model.

## ï¿½ï¿½ Models and Techniques

- **Baseline CNN with SGD (1-layer and deep)**: The shallow model underfits, while the deeper model improves performance.
- **Deep CNN with Adam + EarlyStopping**: Achieved the best performance (81.6% validation accuracy).
- **Transfer Learning with VGG16**: 73.27% accuracy using frozen layers.
- **Testing**: The final model was tested on 20 unseen images, correctly predicting 15/20.

## ï¿½ï¿½ Running the Project
File explanation:
project_1_deep_learning.ipynb - Our code where we build our model.
requirements.txt. - summary of libararies needed to run the code correctly
Multiple model.h5 files - with our saved model results.
app.py - The app file that was used to build the app on HuggingFace spaces. See link below.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_deep_learning.ipynb
```
